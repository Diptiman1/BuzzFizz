In this project, the following points have been taken into consideration for the logic:

1) "Buzz" is displayed when the F(n) is only divisible by 3.

2) "Fizz" is displayed when the F(n) is only divisible by 5.

3) Now due to lack of clarity in the problem statement, "Buzz" "Fizz" and "FizzBuzz" all three is being 
displayed when F(n) is divisible by 15, as we know that a number which is divisible by 15 must be divisible 
by both 3 and 5.

4) A number is checked for prime number if the above condition failed displaying "BuzzFizz"

5) All the above condition diaplays the F(n)

6) Also the sequence have been displayed from 0 till F(n) for better claririty.

7) All test cases have been considered and found to be correct.
